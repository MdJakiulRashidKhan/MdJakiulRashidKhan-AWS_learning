# ☁️ Cloud Computing Full Notes (Day 1)

## 1. What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers,
storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet.

Instead of buying and maintaining physical hardware, users can rent
computing resources from cloud providers and access them through the
internet.

Example: - 🌐 Hosting a web application on AWS EC2 - 💾 Storing files on
Google Drive

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Cloud Service Provider (CSP)

A Cloud Service Provider is a company that delivers cloud computing services over the internet.

Services provided:
- 🖥 Virtual Servers
- 💾 Storage
- 🗄 Databases
- 🌐 Networking
- 🛠 Software

Examples:
- ☁️ Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- ☁️ Microsoft Azure
- ☁️ Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Example:
When you create an EC2 instance in AWS, AWS is your Cloud Service Provider.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Cloud Computing Service Models

### 3.1 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Definition: Provides virtual servers, storage, and networking.

Provider manages: - 🖥 Hardware - 🌐 Networking - ⚙ Virtualization

User manages: - 🖥 Operating System - 🛠 Software - 📦 Application

Examples: - AWS EC2 - Azure Virtual Machine - Google Compute Engine

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.2 PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Definition: Provides platform and environment to run applications.

Provider manages: - 🖥 Server - 🖥 OS - ⚙ Runtime

User manages: - 🛠 Application code

Examples: - Heroku - Google App Engine - Azure App Service

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.3 SaaS (Software as a Service)

Definition: Provides ready-to-use software over the internet.

Provider manages everything.

User: - ✅ Just uses the software

Examples: - 📧 Gmail - 💾 Google Drive - 📝 Microsoft 365

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Cloud Deployment Models

### 4.1 Public Cloud

Infrastructure is owned and managed by cloud providers and shared with
multiple users.

Examples: - AWS - Azure - GCP

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2 Private Cloud

Infrastructure is used by only one organization.

Benefits: - 🔒 More security - 🛡 More control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3 Hybrid Cloud

Combination of public cloud and private cloud.

Benefits: - 🔄 Flexibility - 🔒 Better security and scalability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### On-Demand Self-Service

Users can create and manage resources automatically. ⚡

### Broad Network Access

Accessible from anywhere via internet. 🌐

### Resource Pooling

Resources are shared among multiple users. 🏢

### Rapid Elasticity

Resources can scale up or down quickly. 📈📉

### Measured Service

Pay only for what you use. 💰

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Traditional IT vs Cloud Computing

  Traditional IT             Cloud Computing
  -------------------------- -------------------------
  🖥 Buy hardware             ☁️ Rent resources
  💰 High upfront cost       💳 Pay as you go
  ⚙ Manual scaling           🔄 Automatic scaling
  📍 Limited accessibility   🌐 Access from anywhere

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Shared Responsibility Model

Cloud Provider Responsibilities: - 🖥 Physical hardware - 🏢 Data
centers - 🌐 Networking infrastructure

User Responsibilities: - 🖥 Operating system - 🛠 Application - 🔒 Data
security - ⚙ Configuration

Example: In AWS EC2, AWS manages hardware, user manages OS and
application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Advantages of Cloud Computing

-   💰 Cost effective
-   📈 Scalable
-   🌐 Accessible from anywhere
-   🟢 High availability
-   🔒 Reliable
-   🖥 No hardware required

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Real Example: AWS EC2

Steps: - 🖥 Create EC2 instance - 🛠 Install OS and software - 📦 Deploy
application

This is an example of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Conclusion

Cloud computing is a modern and efficient way to use computing resources
over the internet. It reduces cost, improves scalability, and allows
users to deploy applications quickly without managing physical hardware.

It is widely used in modern software development, DevOps, and enterprise
systems. 🚀
